                <h2>Our Family Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1995 by brothers George and James, G&J Home Services began as a small family operation with a simple mission: to provide honest, reliable, and high-quality home services to our community.</p>
                
                <p>What started as weekend projects for neighbors and friends has grown into a trusted name in construction and home care, but we've never forgotten our roots. Today, the second generation has joined the business, bringing fresh ideas while maintaining the family values that built our reputation.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that your home is more than just a building—it's where your family creates memories, finds comfort, and builds their future. That's why we treat every project, big or small, with the same care and attention we'd give our own family's home.</p>
